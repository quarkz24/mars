# mars ancient climate

# week 1:
- plot diurnally averaged incident solar flux against time for latitudes between +/- 90degrees
    - v4 is current working version
    - current issues with v4: nan at extreme latitudes (close to poles) as a result of tan function (which is behaving mathematically correctly - theory problem?)
    - 
- substitute x for lambda (latitude) in heat diffusion differential equation
    - completed it, but unsure whether it is correct
